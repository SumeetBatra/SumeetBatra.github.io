I am a PhD candidate at the University of Southern California advised by Gaurav Sukhatme in the Robotics Embedded Systems Laboratory (RESL).
I'm interested in creating intelligent systems following neuroscientific perspectives on intelligence. 
That is, agents that learn predictive models of the world that learn from and actively seek out *surprising* or *novel* experiences.
In the past I've worked on Reinforcement Learning (RL), improving exploration in RL via Quality Diversity / Novelty Search methods,
and generative models for robot planning and control. 
I'm currently working on biologically plausible learning algorithms to create more robust and truly generalizable models 
deployable on real robots. 

Over the past two summers, I've had the immense privilege of working with the Autonomous Vehicles team at NVIDIA as a research scientist intern 
on Reinforcement Learning and  Diffusion generative models for automatic scenario generation.
Before that, I was an intern at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), where I worked on Generative Adversarial Networks for 
generating realistic 4G LTE signals.
