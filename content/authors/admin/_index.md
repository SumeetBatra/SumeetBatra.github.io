I am a PhD candidate at the University of Southern California advised by Gaurav Sukhatme in the Robotics Embedded Systems Laboratory (RESL).
My research interests are in biologically inspired machine learning algorithms towards creating generalist agents and more philosophically, 
in algorithms that help us understand the nature of biological intelligence. 
In the past I've worked on Reinforcement Learning (RL), improving exploration in RL via Quality Diversity / Novelty Search methods,
and generative models for robot planning and control. 
I'm currently working on biologically plausible learning algorithms such as theories of predictive coding as generative world models 
for future prediction and active inference. 

Over the past two summers, I've had the immense privilege of working with the Autonomous Vehicles team at NVIDIA as a research scientist intern on Diffusion 
generative models for automatic scenario generation, as well as implementing simulation pipelines for Reinforcement Learning. 
Before that, I was an intern at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), where I worked on Generative Adversarial Networks for 
generating realistic 4G LTE signals.
